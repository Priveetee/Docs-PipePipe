# Introduction

PipePipe is a modern, feature-rich fork of the popular NewPipe application. It is designed to be faster, more stable, and packed with more features.

## About this Fork

PipePipe was forked from NewPipe in early 2022. Due to differences in development philosophy, the projects are now developed independently.

This means that PipePipe neither receives updates from NewPipe nor pushes updates to NewPipe. They have become two separate projects. This "hard fork" approach allows for quick fixes and frequent feature updates.
