::: danger F-Droid: 7-Day Delay Warning
F-Droid is often slow to publish updates. It usually takes **7 days** for a new version to appear.

**If you experience bugs or video playback errors, do not wait for F-Droid.** Update immediately using Obtainium or the GitHub APK.
:::

## 1. Obtainium (Highly Recommended)

Obtainium is the gold standard for PipePipe. It monitors the GitHub repository directly and lets you install updates the second they are released.

*   **Link:** [Download Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases)
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Obtainium.
    2.  Add this URL: `https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe`.
    3.  Obtainium will handle everything from there.

## 2. F-Droid

F-Droid is an open-source catalog of applications. It provides automatic updates but is subject to the 7-day delay mentioned above.

*   **Link:** [Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/)
*   **Note:** Use this only if you don't mind waiting for fixes.

## 3. IzzyOnDroid

IzzyOnDroid is an alternative repository that often syncs faster than the official F-Droid repo.

*   **Link:** [Get it on IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced)
