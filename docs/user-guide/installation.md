# Installation

PipePipe is not available on the Google Play Store. You can install it from one of the following official and safe sources.

::: warning F-Droid Update Delay
While F-Droid is a convenient method, please note that there is usually a **7-day delay** before new updates appear there. If you encounter playback issues (like the "Page needs to be reloaded" error), you should update immediately via GitHub instead.

## Recommended Methods

### Obtainium (Best Experience)
Obtainium allows you to install and update Apps directly from their GitHub releases. This is the best way to get PipePipe updates as soon as they are released by the developer.

1. Install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases).
2. Add the PipePipe repository URL: `https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe`.
3. Obtainium will now notify you and handle updates directly from the source.

### F-Droid
F-Droid is an open-source catalog of applications. It provides automatic updates but with the delay mentioned above.

[Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/)

## Manual Installation

### GitHub Releases
You can always download the latest `.apk` file directly from the project's official GitHub releases page. This is the source for the most urgent bug fixes.

[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe/releases)

::: tip Which file to choose?
Most modern devices use the `arm64-v8a` architecture. If you are unsure, the `universal` APK will work on any device but will result in a larger file size.
