# Installation

PipePipe is not available on the Google Play Store. To ensure you have a smooth experience and receive updates, choose one of the methods below.

::: danger F-Droid: 7-Day Delay Warning
F-Droid is often slow to publish updates. It usually takes **7 days** for a new version to appear. 

**If you experience bugs or video playback errors, do not wait for F-Droid.** Update immediately using Obtainium or the GitHub APK.

## Automatic Updates (Recommended)

### F-Droid & IzzyOnDroid
These are open-source application repositories. Once installed, they will notify you when an update is available.

*   [Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/)
*   [Get it on IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced) (Often faster than F-Droid)

### Obtainium
Obtainium is the best tool for PipePipe. It monitors the GitHub repository directly and installs updates the second they are released.

1.  Install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases).
2.  Add this URL: `https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe`.
