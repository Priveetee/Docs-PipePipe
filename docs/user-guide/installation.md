::: danger F-Droid: 7-Day Delay Warning
F-Droid is often slow to publish updates. It usually takes **7 days** for a new version to appear.

**If you experience bugs or video playback errors, do not wait for F-Droid.** Update immediately using Obtainium or the GitHub APK.
:::

## 1. Obtainium (Highly Recommended)

Obtainium is the gold standard for PipePipe. It monitors the GitHub repository directly and lets you install updates the second they are released.

*   **Link:** [Download Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases)
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Obtainium.
    2.  Add this URL: `https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe`.
    3.  Obtainium will handle everything from there.

## 2. F-Droid

F-Droid is an open-source catalog of applications. It provides automatic updates but is subject to the 7-day delay mentioned above.

*   **Link:** [Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/)
*   **Note:** Use this only if you don't mind waiting for fixes.

## 3. IzzyOnDroid

IzzyOnDroid is an alternative repository that often syncs faster than the official F-Droid repo.

*   **Link:** [Get it on IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced)

## Security and Verification

### APK Signing Certificate (SHA-256)

`dec73429ce2563275f5ed19825e44652b32b363a46f38bdff9ad6dcde4842d88`

::: info Why verify?

## System Requirements

To run PipePipe, your device must meet the following minimum requirements:

*   **Android Version:** Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher.
*   **Architecture:** arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, or x86_64.

If you are using a legacy device (Android 4.4 or lower), PipePipe will not work. In this case, we advise trying [NewPipe-Legacy-Revo](https://github.com/ShareASmile/NewPipe-Legacy-Revo), although it is not officially supported by the PipePipe team.
