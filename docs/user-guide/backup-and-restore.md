# Backup and Restore

All your data in PipePipe (subscriptions, history, playlists) is stored locally on your device. The app does not depend on any cloud service. This is great for privacy, but it means you are responsible for your own backups.

## Creating a Backup

It is highly recommended to back up your data regularly.

1.  Open the main menu (hamburger icon in the top left).
2.  Go to `Settings` > `Backup`.
3.  Tap `Export Database`.
4.  Your phone's file manager will open. Navigate to a safe location to save your backup file.

::: tip Best Practice
Create a dedicated folder for your backups, for example, inside your `Documents` folder, named `Backup_PipePipe`. This makes it easy to find your backups later.

::: warning
Always create a backup before updating the application. It's also a good habit to create one every few weeks.
